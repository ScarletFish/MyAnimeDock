GitHub README Generation Skill
Generate a well-structured, code-consistent, 和 highly readable README.md file for any GitHub repository. Using a dual-engine approach driven by code analysis (ground truth) and user interview (user intent), the skill ensures the README accurately reflects the codebase while conveying the project's proper narrative. Supports multilingual translation and GitHub extended syntax.
<Use_When>

User says "/readme" or "generate README" or "write README" or "update README" or "generate README directly"
User wants a high-quality GitHub README for their project
User needs to restructure an existing README (preserve user narrative + update technical facts)
User needs multilingual README versions
New project initialization, need to create README from scratch </Use_When>
<Do_Not_Use_When>

User only needs to modify a specific paragraph in the README (use Edit tool directly)
User only needs to add a badge or link (use Edit tool directly)
User needs documentation on non-GitHub platforms (refer to other documentation skills)
User explicitly says "don't use skill" or "write README directly" </Do_Not_Use_When>
<Execution_Policy>

Execute the 6 Phases strictly in order, do not skip any Phase
Write checkpoint file (.readme-checkpoint-{N}.md) after each Phase, supporting resume on interruption
Code analysis results take priority over user assumptions: when conflicts are found, code is authoritative and the user is notified
--mode direct skips Phase 2 interview, auto-infers project narrative from code; --mode interview (default) keeps the full interview pipeline
All configuration values must be replaced with placeholders (e.g., <YOUR_API_KEY>), never expose real keys
Never write the final README file until Phase 4 user approval
Interview asks only one question at a time, never batch questions
Context budget strictly follows the file read limits per project size
If Phase 1 code analysis fails (e.g., cannot identify project structure), degrade to interview-only mode and note it </Execution_Policy>
<Execution_Modes> This skill supports two execution modes, specified via the --mode parameter:

interview (default)
Full 6-phase pipeline: Security Gate → Code Analysis → Bidirectional Interview → Generation + Cross-Validation → User Review → Multilingual Translation.

User provides project narrative through single-question interviews (positioning, audience, installation, usage, language)
Gap Check mechanism verifies consistency between user claims and code facts
Suitable for projects requiring precise positioning, complex narratives, or first-time README generation
Default mode, used when --mode is not specified
direct
Skip Phase 2 interview, auto-infer project narrative from code.

Project description: Auto-extracted from package.json description / pyproject.toml description / entry file comments / directory name
Target audience: Defaults to "Developers"
Installation commands: Auto-generated based on detected package manager (npm install / pip install / cargo build etc.), tagged [Auto-generated]
Usage examples: Minimum viable examples generated from API signatures extracted in Phase 1, tagged [Auto-generated]
Multilingual: Only generates source language version (no translation)
Suitable for quick initial README drafts, simple projects, or when user wants to see results first and manually edit later
Usage: /readme --mode direct 或 generate README --mode direct </Execution_Modes>
<Secrets_Exclusion> The following file types must NEVER be read by the Read tool:

.env， .env.*， .env.local， .env.development， .env.production
credentials.*， credentials.json， service-account*.json
*.pem， *.key， *.p12， *.pfx
secrets.*， secrets.yaml， secrets.yml
id_rsa*， id_ecdsa*， id_ed25519*
*.token， private.*， *.private
Any file with secret， credential， private_key in its path
.npmrc (if it contains _authToken) </Secrets_Exclusion>
<Context_Budget> Project size is determined by counting source files via Glob. Source file definition: *.{py,js,ts,jsx,tsx,go,rs,java,rb,php,c,cpp,h,swift,kt,cs,scala,r,rs,ex,exs}, excluding node_modules， .git， dist， build， vendor， target， .next， __pycache__， .venv， venv。

Size	Criterion	Phase 1 File Read Limit	Strategy
Small	Source files <= 50	15 files	Full analysis: entry files + all config + directory tree + key source files
Medium	Source files 50-200	10 files	Sampled analysis: package manifest + entry files + top-level config + key directories
Large	Source files > 200	6 files	Summary analysis: only package manifest + top-level config + entry file sampling
Empty	Source files = 0	0	Degrade to interview-only mode, note "No code detected"
</Context_Budget>			
<GitHub_Extended_Syntax> Generated READMEs should use the following GitHub extended syntax (intelligently selected based on project characteristics):

Required (all READMEs):

Badges (<div align="center"><img alt="...">...</div>): Tests, License, Version, Language. MUST wrap all badges in <div align="center"> to render them horizontally centered. Badges are placed inline (no blank lines between <img> tags) inside the centered div.
Code blocks (with language annotation: python, bash, etc.)
Tables: API reference, configuration options, dependency lists
Anchor links: Table of contents navigation
Language switcher (MUST include if generating >= 2 languages): A <p align="center"> block between the title/badges and the TOC, linking to all language versions with flag emojis.
Conditional: 5. 警示 (> [!NOTE]， > [!WARNING]， > [!IMPORTANT]， > [!CAUTION]): Select appropriate type based on content 6. Collapsed sections (<details><summary>): Detailed installation steps, changelogs, large config blocks 7. Task lists (- [ ] / - [x]): Roadmap, feature status

Optional (marked experimental): 8. Mermaid diagrams: Only generated when project has >= 3 modules, using simple graph TD syntax, with <!-- Experimental: if rendering fails, preview on GitHub --> comment. Avoid complex structures like flowchart， subgraph. </GitHub_Extended_Syntax>

<Interview_Questions> The interview must ask only one question at a time. Each question provides contextual options based on code analysis results.

Q1: Project Introduction & Positioning Based on the tech stack discovered in code analysis, ask: What does this project do? What is its one-line pitch?

Q2: Target Audience Ask: Who will use this project? (Developers / End Users / Operations / Other Teams)

Q3: Installation & Run Instructions Based on the package manager identified in code analysis (npm/pip/cargo/go mod), suggest candidate installation commands and ask user to confirm or modify. → Triggers code recheck: Use Read to verify that dependency names in package.json/requirements.txt/Cargo.toml and script commands match user's description.

Q4: Usage Examples Ask: Please provide 1-2 typical usage scenarios. → Triggers code recheck: Use Read to verify that API signatures and CLI entry arguments match user's examples.

Q5: Multilingual Requirements Ask: Which languages do you need the README in? (Default: source language and English) Options: Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, French, German, etc. Maximum 5 languages.

Gap Check (maximum 2 rounds) After Q1-Q5, check for contradictions based on user answers:

User-claimed API functions that don't exist in actual code → flag and follow up
User installation commands that don't match code's package manager → flag and follow up
User-mentioned config keys inconsistent with actual config files → flag and follow up
Unresolvable contradictions marked as "Pending user review" and preserved in checkpoint </Interview_Questions>
<Checkpoint_Format> Write checkpoint file .readme-checkpoint-{N}.md after each Phase, format:

# README Checkpoint {N}: {Phase Name}
> Time: {timestamp}
> Project: {project_path}
> Size: {small|medium|large|empty}

## Extracted Data
{phase-specific data}

## Decision Log
{key decisions made in this phase}

## Open Issues
{unresolved issues for next phase}
If interrupted and resumed, first check for checkpoint files, continue from the Phase after the last completed one. </Checkpoint_Format>

Phase 0: Security Gate + Existing README Analysis
Goal: Establish security boundaries, check existing documentation, determine project size.

Execution Steps:

Check existing README:

Glob for README.md， readme.md， README.MD in the current project directory
If found, Read the full content, analyze existing structure, identify retainable sections (narrative content such as introduction, usage scenarios, contributor list, acknowledgments)
Record which sections are user narrative (retain) and which are technical facts (will be overwritten by code analysis)
Establish file exclusion list:

Add all patterns listed in Secrets_Exclusion to the exclusion list
Check all subsequent Glob/Read operations against the exclusion list
Determine project size:

Count source files using Glob:
**/*.{py,js,ts,jsx,tsx,go,rs,java,rb,php,c,cpp,h,swift,kt,cs,scala,r,ex,exs}
Exclude node_modules， .git， dist， build， vendor， target， .next， __pycache__， .venv， venv
Determine size tier per Context_Budget table
Write checkpoint:

撰写 .readme-checkpoint-0.md, containing: existing README analysis results, project size tier, exclusion file list
Phase 1: Code Analysis (Token Budgeted)
Goal: Extract technical facts from code, establish ground truth.

Execution Steps:

Identify project type and build system:

Glob for package.json， pyproject.toml， setup.py， requirements.txt， Cargo.toml， go.mod， Gemfile， pom.xml， build.gradle*， CMakeLists.txt， Makefile
Read found manifest files, extract: project name, version, dependencies, script commands
Replace all values with placeholders (e.g., API key → <YOUR_API_KEY>)
Identify entry files:

Look for typical entry files by project type: index.{js,ts}， main.{py,go,rs}， app.{py,js,ts}， src/index.*， src/main.*， src/app.*
Read entry files (counts toward file read quota), extract: primary function/class/API endpoint signatures
Identify license:

Glob for LICENSE， LICENSE.*， LICENCE， COPYING
Read the first line of license file, identify license type (MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL, BSD, etc.)
Deep analysis by size strategy (per size determined in Phase 0):

Small: Read project directory tree, key source files under src/ (up to 15 total files), all config files
Medium: Read entry files + top-level config + file lists from 2-3 key subdirectories under src/ (up to 10 total files)
Large: Read package manifest + top-level config + 1 entry file (up to 6 total files)
Empty: Skip code analysis, mark "No code detected"
Extract structured data:

Language / Framework / Runtime
Package manager
Entry file
Public API signatures
Config key names (values replaced with placeholders)
License type
Project directory structure
Write checkpoint:

撰写 .readme-checkpoint-1.md, containing tech_stack, apis, configs, structure, license, package_manager
Phase 2: Bidirectional Interview (with Gap Check)
Goal: Collect user intent and verify user claims against code through code rechecking.

Execution Steps:

Mode Check: First determine --mode parameter:

If --mode direct: Skip all interview steps below, proceed directly to Direct Mode Auto-Inference (Step 8)
If --mode interview (default): Execute steps 1-7 in order
Interview Mode Steps:
Q1: Project Introduction & Positioning

Based on Phase 1 tech_stack, ask what the project does
Use AskUserQuestion tool, providing context-aware options based on code analysis
Q2: Target Audience

Ask about target user groups
Q3: Installation & Run Instructions

Based on the package manager identified in Phase 1, suggest candidate installation commands
After user response, trigger code recheck:
Read dependency manifest file, verify referenced dependency names exist
Read package.json scripts / Makefile targets, verify referenced run commands are valid
On mismatch: notify user, code is authoritative
Q4: Usage Examples

Ask for 1-2 typical usage scenarios
After user response, trigger code recheck:
Read entry file or API file, verify function/endpoint signatures mentioned by user
On mismatch: notify user, code is authoritative
Q5: Multilingual Requirements

AskUserQuestion: Which languages are needed for the README?
Provide common language options (Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, French, German, etc.)
Default includes at least source language and English; maximum 5
Gap Check (maximum 2 rounds):

Synthesize Q1-Q5 user answers against Phase 1 code facts
Find contradictions: API functions not found, config key mismatches, install command mismatches with package manager
For each contradiction, Read the relevant source file to confirm, then follow up with user for clarification
If unresolved after round 1, proceed to round 2
If still unresolved after 2 rounds, mark as "Pending user review" and preserve
Write checkpoint:

撰写 .readme-checkpoint-2.md, containing purpose, audience, install_steps, usage_examples, languages, gap_check_results
Direct Mode Auto-Inference (Skip Interview):
Auto-infer project narrative (only --mode direct):

Project Description:

Extract from package.json description field
Or from pyproject.toml [project] description
Or from Cargo.toml [package] description
If none found, extract from top comment in entry file
If still none, use directory name as project name + "A software project" placeholder description
Tag as [Auto-generated from code analysis]
Target Audience:

Default "Developers"
Installation Commands:

npm project: npm install + npm run <start-script>
pip project: pip install -e . 或 pip install -r requirements.txt
cargo project: cargo build --release + cargo run
go project: go build ./... + go run .
All tagged [Auto-generated]
Usage Examples:

Generate 1-2 minimal code examples from Phase 1 API signatures
CLI projects: generate --help style usage examples
Library projects: generate import + minimal invocation examples
All tagged [Auto-generated]
Language:

Source language only (no translation), marked as single-language output
Write checkpoint:

撰写 .readme-checkpoint-2.md, containing auto_inferred purpose, audience, install_steps, usage_examples, languages=single, tagged mode: direct
Phase 3: README Generation + Cross-Validation
Goal: Generate a README draft and cross-validate against source code to ensure accuracy.

Execution Steps:

Build README structure: Required sections (in order):

Title (with badges)
Table of Contents (anchor links)
Introduction
Installation
Usage
API Reference
Contributing
License
Apply GitHub extended syntax:

Badges: Tests, License, Version, Language — using <div align="center"><img alt="...">...</div> format. All badge <img> tags MUST be inside a centered div, placed inline with no blank lines between them to render horizontally.
Language switcher (when >= 2 languages): A <p align="center"> block right after badges (before TOC), containing flag emoji + links to all language versions. Example: <p align="center">🇺🇸 <a href="./README.md">English</a> | 🇨🇳 <a href="./README.zh.md">简体中文</a></p>
Code blocks: all code examples with language annotation
Tables: API reference, configuration options presented as tables
Anchor links: each section in TOC with anchors
Alerts: use > [!NOTE] / > [!WARNING] / > [!IMPORTANT] / > [!CAUTION] in appropriate places
Collapsed sections: wrap detailed install steps and large config blocks with <details><summary>
Task lists: roadmap items with - [ ] / - [x]
Mermaid diagrams: only when >= 3 modules (marked experimental)
Cross-validation (critical step):

Extract all technical claims from the generated README (API signatures, config keys, CLI commands, dependency names)
Re-read up to 5 key source files, verify each item
On mismatch: correct the README claim
After cross-validation completes, record validation results
Write checkpoint:

撰写 .readme-checkpoint-3.md, containing full README draft + cross_check_report
Phase 4: User Review Gate
Goal: User reviews the README draft, confirms before final output.

Execution Steps:

Present README draft:

Show user the complete README generated in Phase 3
Annotate content sources: which come from code analysis (tag [Code]), which from interview (tag [Interview]), which are auto-inferred (tag [Auto-generated], direct mode only)
Provide structural completeness report:

List whether all required sections exist
GitHub syntax usage checklist
User decision:

User says "done" / "ok" / "confirm" / "approved" → proceed to Phase 5
User requests changes → adjust README based on feedback, return to end of Phase 3 to regenerate draft
Maximum 3 revision rounds
If still unsatisfied after 3 rounds: save current draft as README.draft.md, suggest manual editing
Overwrite strategy:

If README.md already exists: AskUserQuestion whether to overwrite or save as README.new.md
If not: mark that README.md will be written
Note: This Phase does not write a checkpoint file; wait for user confirmation.

Phase 5: Multilingual Translation
Goal: Translate the final README into target languages.

Mode Check:

If --mode direct: Skip translation, proceed directly to Phase 6. Direct mode only generates source-language README.
If --mode interview (default): Execute translation per steps below.
Execution Steps:

Prerequisite: Phase 4 user confirmed + non-direct mode

Translation rules:

Preserve all code block content unchanged
Preserve all API names, function signatures, class names unchanged
Only translate descriptive text (headings, paragraphs, text descriptions in tables)
Badge URL label text adjusted per language
Alert block titles translated (e.g., > [!NOTE] → localized equivalent)
Mermaid diagram node labels translated
Language switcher (MANDATORY for >= 2 languages):

Insert a <p align="center"> language switcher in EVERY translated README, positioned after the badges and before the TOC
Use flag emojis: 🇺🇸 English, 🇨🇳 简体中文, 🇯🇵 日本語, 🇰🇷 한국어, 🇫🇷 Français, 🇩🇪 Deutsch
Link each flag to the corresponding README.{lang}.md (or README.md for the default language)
Example for zh,en output:
<p align="center">
🇺🇸 <a href="./README.md">English</a> | 🇨🇳 <a href="./README.zh.md">简体中文</a>
</p>
The language switcher content itself is NOT translated — it stays identical across all language versions
Processing flow:

If target languages > 2, process each language sequentially
撰写 README.{lang}.md after each language translation completes
Save progress between each language translation
Optional localization notes:

Confirm with user during interview whether to add region-specific links (community links, mirrors, etc.)
Write checkpoint:

撰写 .readme-checkpoint-5.md, listing all translated language versions and file paths
Phase 6: Final Output
Goal: Write final files and clean up.

Execution Steps:

Write main README:

Based on Phase 4 user choice, write README.md (overwrite mode) or README.new.md (preserve original mode)
Write multilingual versions:

撰写 README.{lang}.md for each target language (e.g., README.zh.md， README.ja.md)
Clean up checkpoint files:

删除 .readme-checkpoint-0.md
删除 .readme-checkpoint-1.md
删除 .readme-checkpoint-2.md
删除 .readme-checkpoint-3.md
删除 .readme-checkpoint-5.md
(Phase 4 has no checkpoint, no cleanup needed)
Output summary:

List all generated files and paths
Report GitHub syntax usage stats (badge count, table count, alert types, etc.)
Report cross-validation results (how many items checked, how many corrected)
Remind user of any "Pending user review" contradictions
<Integrated_Quality_Check> The following quality check results must be included in the output summary after generation:

Structural Completeness (Required Items Check)
 Title with horizontally centered badges (<div align="center">)
 Language switcher (MANDATORY if >= 2 languages; <p align="center"> with flag emoji links to all language versions)
 TOC with anchor links
 Introduction section
 Installation section
 Usage section
 API Reference section (if applicable)
 Contributing section
 License section
Code Consistency (Cross-Validation)
 Phase 3 cross-validation completed
 API signatures match source code
 Config key names match source code
 Installation commands match package manager
GitHub Syntax Usage
 Badges (<div align="center"><img alt="..."></div> — centered, horizontal)
 Language switcher (MANDATORY if >= 2 languages; <p align="center"> with flag emoji links)
 Code blocks (with language annotation)
 Tables
 Anchor links
 Alerts (if applicable)
 Collapsed sections (if applicable)
 Task lists (if applicable)
 Mermaid diagrams (if applicable, marked experimental)
Security Check
 No keys/tokens/passwords exposed
 No internal endpoints exposed
 All configuration values are placeholders </Integrated_Quality_Check>
<Recovery_Procedure> If execution is interrupted (timeout, network error, user cancellation, etc.):

When re-invoking this skill, first check for .readme-checkpoint-*.md 文件
If checkpoint files exist, read the latest checkpoint
Resume from the Phase after the last completed one
"Open Issues" in checkpoints are prioritized on resume
If Phase 1 code analysis checkpoint exists, skip Phase 0-1, start directly from Phase 2
If all checkpoints exist and Phase 4 was confirmed, start from Phase 5 </Recovery_Procedure>
<Edge_Cases>

Empty project: Phase 1 skips code analysis. Interview mode: Phase 2 relies entirely on interview. Direct mode: generates minimal placeholder README, tagged "⚠️ This project contains no detectable code yet. Please update the README after actual development."
No package manager file: Skip install command auto-inference, ask user directly in Phase 2 Q3 how to install
No LICENSE file: Ask user in Phase 2 about intended license, tag license section as "To be confirmed"
Existing README seriously inconsistent with code: Flag in Phase 0, highlight conflicting content in Phase 4 presentation
User skips interview questions: If user declines to answer a question, fill that section with code analysis results, tagged [Auto-generated from code analysis] </Edge_Cases>
